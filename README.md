A transpiler converts source code from one programming language to another, while a compiler translates source code into machine code.

---

=> npx means you are executing an npm package parcel and you give a source file as index.html
=> these commands are different for developer and production build.
=> to make our life easier what we do is we create a script that will build our project instead of
writing "npx parcel index.html".
=> React element is an object which will be change as html element once it is rendered on the dom.

=> jsx is not HTML in JS / it just looks like HTML.
=> reactElement is the Object and jsx is a syntax.

# Is jsx a valid javascript?

=> Just for the time being, no it is not the valid pure JS,
=> Because what is a valid JS, which is comprehended by the JS Engine.
=> JS engine only comprehends only ECMAscript.
=> try paste this line in console "const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Sharif</h1>;"
=> parcel does the thing behind the sean. The above line is developed by the developers.
=> Before going to the js engine it is transpiled and js engine receives the code which browsers can understand.
=> And transpiling not done by the parcel directly it is the responsibility of Babel

# => jsx => babel transpile to React.createElement => reactElement-js Object => HTML Element(render)

# types of components in React

=> Class Component
=> Functional Component

# What is a React functional component?

=> A function that returns jsx is a react functional component
